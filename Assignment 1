###Opportunity
Since Mountcastle’s seminal work in systems neuroscience nearly 60 years ago, our understanding of cortical function has primarily relied on single unit recordings [JNS]. This paradigm successfully elucidated the functions of individual neurons across different cortical regions, and also gave us a basic understanding of the functional organization of the brain (cortical columns, somatotopy). However, single-unit recordings, and even multi-unit electrophysiology, cannot reveal the small-scale “wiring diagram” that underlies basic neural units. Without this knowledge, basic understanding of information-processing in cortex remains elusive. Much effort is being devoted to mapping the connectome of cortex across flies, rodents, and ultimately humans [HCP]. Electron microscopy has allowed neuroscientists to map the 3D spatial coordinates of neurons and their synapses [FNA, NTR]. This constitutes a key development in our ability map the human connectome.

###Significance
The ultimate goal of systems neuroscience is to fully map the human connectome and understand how information is processed through the network [HCP]. This project constitutes an important early step towards this goal. We aim to characterize the statistical features of the 3D spatial distribution of synapses in a cortical region, and assess how the distribution changes across [DMT] cortical layers, cell types the synapses belong to, and possibly surrounding cortical columns. This will provide the first insight of statistical features of the connectome as they relate to classic cortical structures (layers and columns).

###Feasibility
With access to annotated electron microscopy images, we plan to analyze the 3D distribution of synapses within the macroscopic structures/organization of the brain, such as for different cortex layers or within columnar regions. Our ability to do so will depend on the size of the area imaged and how well the different areas and structures are annotated. We also hope to be able to analyze the 3D distribution of synapses relative to individual neurons, which will require using an automatic or semi-automatic algorithm to trace synapses back to the cell body. We anticipate that the second aim of our proposal may be difficult to accomplish if quality data sets and/or robust image processing algorithms are not readily available. If so, we will focus our efforts on the first aim.

###Innovation
If successful, this project will leverage a relatively new technique (electron microscopy) provide insight into one of the most critical aspects of neuronal organization, namely, the synapses. This work can potentially shed light how the 3D structure of synapse distribution relates to functional communication pathways in the brain, contributing towards the ultimate goal of mapping the network structure of the brain.
