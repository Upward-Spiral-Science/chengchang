####Descriptive
* What does the synapse location data look like?  
 * 3D location for every synapse?    
 * average # of synapses within a “voxel”?
* Are cell bodies annotated or obvious?  
* What area of cortex?  
* Chemical vs. electrical synapses: are the two types differentiated in the labeling?  
* What is the size of the scanned volume?  
 * From Anton-Sanchez 2014: 4500um^3, measuring 4000 synapses from 3 animals?  
 * What is the density /resolution?  
   * What are the direction of brain slices?   
   * resolution in the “z” direction vs. “x, y” direction  
* How many animals / samples do we have?  

####Exploratory
* What are the differences in distribution across layers?  
 * How do we tell between the different layers?  
* What sort of clustering?  
 * Can we assess columnar organization?  
 * Can we separate functional groups (i.e. excitatory vs. inhibitory cells)?  
   * From Bock2011: pg2: categorized postsynaptic targets based on morphology?  
* Is it obvious which synapses belong to which cells?   
 * From Bock2011 pg2: was able to retrace the dentrite to the cell body?    
   * Were able to isolate a target cell, and trace the inputs into that cell?

####Inferential
* Similar to clustering in the Exploratory section: (example)  
 * ${H_0}$: mean distance between synapses the same across cortical layers/columns  
 * ${H_A}$: difference in mean distance between synapses across cortical layers/columns  

####Predictive
* What is the statistical distribution of synapses within the cortical layers? Within columns?  
 * Can we predict/classify the cortical layer or column or cell type being shown, based on the 3D structure of synapse locations?  

####Causal
* Are the statistics we find consistent across different subjects?
