#### Descriptive

-   How many NA, Inf, or other "bad" data values are there?  
-   Quantities
    -   How many synapses total are there?  
    -   How many bins are there?  
-   Statistics
    -   What's the mean number of synapses within a bin?  
    -   What's the median number of synapses per bin?  
    -   What's the standard deviation?  
-   What is the size of the scanned volume?

#### Exploratory

-   What do the distributions of synapse locations look like in the x,
    y, z coordinates?  
-   What do some representative slices look like?

#### Inferential

-   Similar to clustering in the Exploratory section: (example)
    -   *H*<sub>0</sub>: mean distance between synapses the same across
        cortical layers/columns  
    -   *H*<sub>*A*</sub>: difference in mean distance between synapses
        across cortical layers/columns

#### Predictive

-   What is the statistical distribution of synapses within the cortical
    layers? Within columns?
    -   Can we predict/classify the cortical layer or column or cell
        type being shown, based on the 3D structure of synapse
        locations?

#### Causal

-   Are the statistics we find consistent across different subjects?
